# New Features

Before modifying the behavior of the interpreter, attempt to implement your feature using MSL alone.
Follow the following steps in order when developing your feature.
If the current step fails, return to the previous step.

1. Requirements - Determine the requirements of the new feature.
2. Check - Determine that the feature is not currently available and adequite within the MSL ecosystem based on your requirements.
3. Prototype - Write a working test of this feature using MSL.
4. Implement - Fully implment your feature using MSL.
5. Test - Test that your feature works in a predictable and repeatable manner.
6. Optimize - Work to optimize your implementation for its use case.
7. Test - Test that your feature still works in a predictable and repeatable manner.
8. Submit Pull Request - Explain what your feature provides, how it's used, and its intended use case.
9. Review - It's possible that another user will find an issue with your feature before it's merged; address any detected issues.
