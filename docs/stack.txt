Pushing to the Stack
    - Elements are pushed to the stack as part of lists.
    - If at least one list is present on the stack, elements can be appended to that list.

Creating Lists
    - Create a list with a pair of square brackets.
    - When a list is pushed to the stack, the first item pushed is the opening sqaure bracket which marks the beginning of the list. This allows commands to know where a set of values end and when they're about to cross into another list.
    - Usage
        [1 2 3]
        print-stack
        # 0 : [
        # 1 : 1
        # 2 : 2
        # 3 : 3

Appending Lists
    - Append elements to the top list on the stack by placing the new elements between a pair of curly brackets.
    - Usage
        [1 2 3]
        {4 5 6}
        print-stack
        # 0 : [
        # 1 : 1
        # 2 : 2
        # 3 : 3
        # 4 : 4
        # 5 : 5
        # 6 : 6

Dropping Lists
    - To drop the top list from the stack, use the drop-list command.
    - Usage
        [1 2 3]
        [4 5 6]
        drop-list
        print-stack
        # 0 : [
        # 1 : 1
        # 2 : 2
        # 3 : 3

Dropping Elements
    - To drop the last element of the top list on the stack, use the drop command.
    - Usage
        [1 2 3]
        drop
        print-stack
        # 0 : [
        # 1 : 1
        # 2 : 2
        # 3 : 3
